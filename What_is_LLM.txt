📘 What is LLM (Large Language Model)?

💡 Introduction
LLM stands for Large Language Model. It is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that is trained to understand and generate human language. These models are capable of answering questions, writing content, translating languages, generating code, and more.

🧠 How does an LLM work?
An LLM is trained on massive amounts of text data — including books, websites, and articles. It learns the patterns of language and uses them to:

- Understand human input
- Generate human-like responses
- Translate between languages
- Create code and solve problems

🧱 LLM Meaning Breakdown

Term       | Meaning
-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------
Large      | Trained on huge datasets (billions of words).
Language   | Focused on understanding and producing human language.
Model      | A statistical system that learns from data and makes intelligent predictions.

🔧 Technology Behind LLMs
LLMs are built using Neural Networks, especially a type called Transformers — introduced by Google in 2017. These models are powerful enough to handle complex language tasks.
